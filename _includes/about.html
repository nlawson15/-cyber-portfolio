        <p>Currently as a career coach for cyber security and data analytics-My passion lies in empowering individuals and organizations to thrive, underpinned by a commitment to innovation and service. I am a community builder and everyday I get to help people develop their skills professionally. With over a decade of successful experience working with people  in corporate management, business development, and program management, I have successfully transitioned into tech through my unique blend of strategic insight, hands-on expertise and overall curiosity of systems to the field of tech. What sets me apart in this realm is my unwavering commitment to equipping teams with the tools and skills they need to achieve independence and confidence. By fostering a culture of learning and growth, I aim to ensure that organizations not only recover from incidents but also build resilience for the future. Whether addressing a security breach or implementing preventive measures, I am dedicated to creating an environment where ongoing growth and fulfillment are paramount. My philosophy centers on the principle of "yes, and?"â€”a mindset that supports continuous development and adaptability in an ever-evolving digital landscape. I've had the opportunity to apply this in my experience of both leadership and consultant positions from start-ups to large organizations in varying industries.</p>
